### dev-template

**please consider using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) or [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) instead as they're better tools**

quickly scaffold python projects  
designed to skip the bloat and get straight to coding

sets up a basic project structure with dirs like `src`, `tests`, and optional config files like `pyproject.toml`

supports:

- simple config to set defaults like base path or template location
- interactive prompts with path autocomplete
- automatic venv creation and package install
- drop-in templates you can customize

design was inspired by always repeating the same setup steps just to write a small script  
wanted something fast and local to keep my projects organized without thinking too much
