## claim to fame

### dev-template

quickly scaffold python projects  
designed to skip the bloat and get straight to coding

sets up a basic project structure with dirs like `src`, `tests`, and optional config files like `pyproject.toml`

supports:
- simple config to set defaults like base path or template location
- interactive prompts with path autocomplete
- automatic venv creation and package install
- drop-in templates you can customize

design was inspired by always repeating the same setup steps just to write a small script  
wanted something fast and local to keep my projects organized without thinking too much  
not maintained anymore but it still works (hopefully) if you want to use it or borrow ideas
